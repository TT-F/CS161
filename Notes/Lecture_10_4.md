## Problem Solving & Search
* Problem Solving & Search
    * formulate as search probem (Initial State, finite goal state, actions) -> search engine <- search strategy (blind/uninformed, informed)
    * ex. 8-puzzle
        * make this a search problem 
            * actions = left/right/up/down 
            * subject = blank box 
            * naive search: for every move, create two subtrees for two possible actions. 
    * Nice abstract way of finding 
    * successor-function (s)]        '
